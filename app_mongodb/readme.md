Flutter MongoDB Atlas Demo

This project demonstrates how to connect a Flutter app to MongoDB Atlas using a Node.js/Express backend. The app allows users to submit data (name and email), which is stored in a MongoDB Atlas database. The app works on both web (e.g., Microsoft Edge) and mobile platforms (Android/iOS).

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:





Flutter (for the app)



Node.js (for the backend)



Git (to clone the repository)



A MongoDB Atlas account (for the database)

Youâ€™ll also need:





A code editor like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.



A mobile device or emulator for testing (if running on mobile).



Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:





Backend: A Node.js/Express server that connects to MongoDB Atlas and handles API requests.



Frontend: A Flutter app that sends data to the backend and displays stored data.

Key files:





server.js: The backend server code.



api_service.dart: Handles API requests from the Flutter app.



main.dart: The main Flutter app file.



Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Replace yourusername and your-repo-name with your GitHub details.

2. Set Up the Backend





Navigate to the backend folder:

cd backend



Install the required Node.js packages:

npm install



Create a .env file in the backend folder and add your MongoDB Atlas connection string:

MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Replace <username>, <password>, and <database> with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.



Start the backend server:

node server.js

You should see "ðŸš€ Server running on port 3000" and "ðŸŒŸ Connected to MongoDB Atlas!" in the terminal.

3. Set Up the Flutter App





Navigate to the Flutter app folder:

cd ../flutter_app



Install the required Flutter packages:

flutter pub get



Update the baseUrl in api_service.dart:





Open lib/api_service.dart.



Replace 'http://192.168.1.100:3000' with your computerâ€™s IP address. To find your IP:





Windows: Run ipconfig in Command Prompt and look for "IPv4 Address".



macOS/Linux: Run ifconfig or ip addr in Terminal.



Example:

return 'http://192.168.1.5:3000';  // Replace with your actual IP



Running the App

Run on Web (Edge)





Ensure the backend is running (node server.js).



In the Flutter app folder, run:

flutter run -d web-server --web-port 5000



Open Microsoft Edge and go to http://localhost:5000.



Enter data in the app and submit. Check MongoDB Atlas to confirm the data was saved.

Run on Mobile (Android/iOS)





Ensure the backend is running (node server.js).



Connect your mobile device via USB and enable Developer Options and USB Debugging.



In the Flutter app folder, check available devices:

flutter devices



Run the app on your device:

flutter run -d <device_id>

Replace <device_id> with your deviceâ€™s ID from the previous command.



Enter data in the app and submit. Check MongoDB Atlas to confirm the data was saved.

Note: Ensure your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.



Troubleshooting





App canâ€™t connect to backend on mobile:





Check that your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.



Ensure the baseUrl in api_service.dart uses your computerâ€™s correct IP address.



Verify the backend is running and accessible by opening http://<your_computer_ip>:3000 in your phoneâ€™s browser.



Data not saving to MongoDB:





Check the backend terminal for errors (e.g., MongoDB connection issues).



Ensure your .env file has the correct MONGODB_URI.



NDK version warning:





Update android/app/build.gradle.kts (or build.gradle) with:

android {
    ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"
}



Then run flutter clean and flutter run.

For more help, check the Flutter documentation or MongoDB Atlas documentation.
